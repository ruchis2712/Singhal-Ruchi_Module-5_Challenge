# Singhal-Ruchi_Module-5_Challenge

## Summary Data Frame
It showcases the following for each city type:
 - Total Rides
 - Total Drivers
 - Total Fares
 - Average Fare per Ride
 - Average Fare per Driver

We observe that:

(1) Rural city types have the highest fare per ride and per driver

(2) But rural cities also have the lowest number of rides and drivers

(3) Highest number of rides and driver count can be seen in Urban cities

(4) But the Urban cities have the lowest fare per ride and driver

(5) The number of rides in Urban cities is approx. 2.5 times Suburban cities and 13 times Rural cities

(6) The driver count in Urban cities is approx. 7 times Suburban cities and 110 times Rural cities

(7) But the fare per ride is approx. 20% lower than Suburban cities and 30% lower than Rural cities

(8) Fare per driver for Urban cities is 4 times lower than Suburgan and 12 times lower than Rural


### Key Takeaway: Even though Urban cities have lower fares, but the very high number of rides in these cities result in the highest overall revenue from this city type


## Monthly fares by city type line chart

We observe that:

(1) From Jan.2019 to April 2019, month to month total fares, for Suburban and Rural city types, have shown very small change and look almost stable

(2) Even though the month to month total fares show very small change, they are on the deciling trend for Suburban city types and upward trend for Rural city types. Further analysis on number of rides and avg. fare per ride by month can reveal the contributing factor(s) to this trend

(3) The Urban fares show an upward trend with a huge spike in the month of March. Further analysis is required to identify the contributing factor(s). For e.g. there maybe a local event that was attracting travelers to city(s) and causing a surge in the number of rides in the month of March


### Key Takeaway: Overall demand for Pyber services seems to be nudging upwards. Further analysis is required to identify contributing factors and also reasons for continued decline in suburban cities
